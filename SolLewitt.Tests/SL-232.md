Wall Drawing # 232

A square, each side of which is equal to a tenth of the total length of three lines, 
the first of which is drawn from a point halfway between the center of the wall and a point halfway between the center of the wall and the upper left corner and the midpoint of the left side to a point halfway between the center of the wall and a point halfway between the center of the wall and the midpoint of the bottom side; 
the second line is drawn from a point halfway between the start of the first line and a point halfway between the center of the wall and the upper right corner and the midpoint of the top side to the start of the first line; 
the third line is drawn from a point halfway between a point equidistant from the end of the first line, the start of the second line and a point halfway between a point halfway between the center of the wall and the midpoint of the right side and a point halfway between the center of the wall and the upper right corner and the midpoint of the top side to the point where the first line starts and the second line ends; 
the right side is located on the axis of, and equidistant from two points, the first of which is located at a point halfway between a point halfway between the center of the wall and the midpoint of the right side and the lower right corner to a point halfway between a point halfway between the midpoint of the top side and the upper right corner and the start of the third line.


# Corrected Syntax

	A square, 
	each side of which is equal to a tenth of the total length of three lines, 

	the first of which is drawn 
	from 
		a point halfway between // Added to correct Syntax Error 1
			a point halfway between 
				the center of the wall 
				and 
				a point halfway between 
					the center of the wall 
					and 
					the upper left corner 
		and // Syntax Error 1
		the midpoint of the left side 
	to 
		a point halfway between 
			the center of the wall 
			and 
			a point halfway between 
				the center of the wall 
				and 
				the midpoint of the bottom side; 

	the second line is drawn 
	from 
		a point halfway between // Added to correct Syntax Error 2
			a point halfway between 
				the start of the first line 
				and 
				a point halfway between 
					the center of the wall 
					and

		and // Syntax Error 2
		the midpoint of the top side 
	to 
		the start of the first line; 

	the third line is drawn 
	from
