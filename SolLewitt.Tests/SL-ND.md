A quadrangle which is formed and enclosed by four lines, the first of which is drawn from a point halfway between a point
halfway between the center of the wall and the upper left corner and the midpoint of the left side and the upper left corner 
to a point halfway between the midpoint of the top side and the upper right corner, the second line from a point
halfway between the start of the first line and a point halfway between the midpoint of the top side and the upper left
corner to a point halfway between a point halfway between the center of the wall and the lower left corner and the midpoint 
of the bottom side, the third line from a point halfway between a point halfway between the start of the first line and
the end of the second line and a point halfway between the midpoint of the left side and the lower left corner to a point
which is on an axis between the lower left corner to a point halfway between the midpoint of the right side and the upper
right corner where a line drawn from the center of the wall to a point halfway between the midpoint of the right side and
the lower right corner would cross that axis, the fourth line from a point equidistant from the end of the third line, the end
of the second line and a point halfway between a point halfway between the center of the wall and the midpoint of the
bottom side and a point halfway between the midpoint of the bottom side and the lower right corner to a point halfway
between the start of the second line and a point where a line would cross the first line if it were drawn from the midpoint
of the right side to a point halfway between the midpoint of the top side and the upper left corner.
